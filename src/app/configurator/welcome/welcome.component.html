  <h2 class="text-center">Welcome to the Configurator!</h2>
  <p>
    We are happy to finally present you the awesome Configurator!<br />
    You may have already heard what Configurator is about, but let us remind
    you. Basically, this tool is about:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Helping you to pick compatible components for you keyboard,</li>
    <li>
      Allowing you to see your keyboard before it arrives with the power of 3D,
      <em>*Work In Progress</em>
    </li>
    <li>Applying different modifications to your new keyboard.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="text-red-900">
    Note: not all features are available as of now, as we are still working on
    some of them. Please, give us some time to polish the features and provide
    you with the best experience!
  </p>
  So, now that you are familiar with the Configurator's powers, you can start
  with it right away!
