        You may have already heard what Configurator is about, but let us remind you. Basically, this tool will assist you with:

            <li>Picking right components for you keyboard,</li>
            <li>Allowing you to see your keyboard before it arrives with the power of 3D,</li>
            <li>Applying the most necessary modification to your new keyboard.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-red-900">Note: not all features are available as of now, as we are still working on some of them. Please, give us some time to polish the features and provide you with the best experience!</p>
