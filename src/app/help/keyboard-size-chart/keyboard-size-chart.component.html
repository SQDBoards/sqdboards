      <h2>40% - the Tiniest</h2>
      <p>
        40% keyboards are the most barebones keyboard available that you can
        still type on. On top of everything removed for 60% keyboards (no number
        pad, function row, arrow keys, home cluster), 40% keyboards also get rid
        of all the numbers on the top row. That's right, there are no numbers on
        this keyboard layout. In addition, you also get rid of all the
        non-letter keys such as the semi-colon, quotes, etc.

      <h2>60% - what Many Consider</h2>
      <p>
        60% keyboards are popular in the gaming and mechanical keyboard
        enthusiast keyboard community. Not quite a common as TKL or fullsized,
        but there are a lot of different 60% keyboards available online. Due to
        their small, compact, and symmetrical shape, they are the most common
        size for custom keyboard builds.

      <h2>65% - Slightly Bigger</h2>
      <p>
        65% keyboards take compactness to a whole new level. Instead of just
        getting rid of the number pad, these keyboards also drop the function
        row and the home cluster (on some layouts)! Who needs those extra keys
        anyways? This is the smallest keyboard size you can get that will still
        have arrow keys. Like 75% keyboards, 65% are less common but have a
        small fan-base in the keyboard community. Two different layouts are
        presented on photos.

    <div>
      <h2>75% - Something Undiscovered</h2>
      <p>
        75% keyboards have an interesting design. They are a slightly more
        compact version of a tenkeyless board, they place the arrow keys and
        home cluster right next to each other and align the home cluster
        vertically to save space. This allows for everything to be packed in
        tight and snug. There are a lot less 75% keyboards on the market, so
        your options will be limited.

    <div>
      <h2>80% (aka TKL) - The Long Runner</h2>
      <p>
        Tenkeyless keyboards typically have 87 keys, the perfect layout to
        balance size and functionality. Unlike full-sized keyboards, they do not
        have a number pad which makes the keyboard more compact and easier to
        take on the go. Most people don't use the number pad heavily, so they
        are able to get rid of the extra baggage without it impacting their
        typing too much.

    <div>
      <h2>100% (aka Full-Size) - The One We All Started With</h2>
      <p>
        Full-sized keyboards are the go-to for people who need to do lots of
        data entry and require frequent use of the number pad. Full-sized
        keyboards are standard in offices and is what most people think of when
        they imagine a keyboard. The full-sized keyboards come standard with a
        number pad, home cluster, function keys, and arrow keys. The number pad
        is typically located on the right, but some keyboards come with it on
        the left.
